# FPS AI HELPER
<font color=Red>Warning: This project can only be used for academic purpose</font>

To improve my gaming skills, I design this program. It employs YOLO and PID controller to achieve automatic aiming in
FPS games. The deployment is done using the NCNN framework, with support for the UI provided by the Qt frame-
work. This tool can run on NVIDIA GPUs thanks to Vulcan framework.
